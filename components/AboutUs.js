We are always finding ways to help our local communities and partner with charities of every scale. Over the years, we have carried product that has helped different organizations, such as Give to Love, Love to Give. We have also developed collaborative products with proceeds benefiting charitable organizations. A current exciting project is with Project Level to develop a collaborative line of products. Project Level is an amazing non-profit organization which nurtures the creative needs of at-risk and underserved inner-city youth in the San Francisco Bay area. When we partner with an organization on a specific collection, a portion of the proceeds is donated to the designated charity.</p>
